The notebook of my Master's Thesis. You can find the thesis at this link : https://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/58279

It is a very big notebook, so you can download it and play with.

There, you can find:
* The preparation of the Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUIS) that I used.
* The creation and training of a U - Net model.
* The creation and training of a Attention U - Net.

The two models are created with Tensorflow.
